# Music-Sequencer
A musical sequencer storage application based on musical notes in the form of nodes stored in BSTs.

A project for 2019 CSCA48: Introduction to Computer Science II course.

Features basic functions such as:
* pre-order, in-order, and post-order tree traversals
* shifting certain frequencies in the tree
* deleting, searching, and inserting new/existing nodes
* deleting the tree
* converting tree to a linked list
* harmonizes song by inserting a new, shifted note for every existing note in tree

### For compilation:

```shell
gcc A2_test_driver.c -lm
```
Or with the interactive driver,
```shell
gcc A2_interactive_driver.c -lm
```
